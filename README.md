## Project Overview
SocialMediaApp is an opinionated full-stack application template for building a modern social network. It includes user authentication, user profiles, the ability to create and interact with posts (like, comment), follow/unfollow users, and basic notification support. The project is intended as a starting point you can extend and customize for production use.

## Key Features
- User registration and authentication (JWT / session-based)
- User profiles with avatar support
- Create, edit, delete posts (text, images)
- Likes and comments
- Follow / unfollow other users
- Basic notifications feed (for likes, comments, follows)
- RESTful API for backend

## Architecture
- Backend exposes a versioned REST API (e.g., /api/v1/...)
- Frontend is a single-page app communicating with the API
- Media files served via a dedicated storage service (S3/Cloudinary) or CDN
- Typical authentication flow: client sends credentials → server issues JWT → client attaches token to Authorization header

## Quick Start (Local Development)

Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 16) and npm or yarn
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL running locally (or a remote DB URL)
- (Optional) Docker & docker-compose for a containerized setup
- (Optional) AWS account / storage provider credentials if using S3/Cloudinary

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/MithunDu404/SocialMediaApp.git
   cd SocialMediaApp

2. Install dependencies
   - If the repo is split into `server/` and `client/`:
     - Backend:
       cd server
       npm install
     - Frontend:
       cd ../client
       npm install
   - If it's a monorepo or single package, run npm install at repo root.

3. Create environment files
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or create `.env` for both server and client) and fill in values (see examples below).

4. Run services
   - Backend (development):
     cd server
     npm run dev
     - or: nodemon index.js / node src/index.js
   - Frontend (development):
     cd client
     npm start
     - or: npm run dev (Vite/Next)

5. Open the app
   - Frontend usually available at http://localhost:3000 (or port configured)
   - Backend API typically at http://localhost:5000 (or port configured)

## Environment Variables (.env examples)

Backend (.env)
- Replace values with your secrets / config
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/socialmediaapp
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
# If using AWS S3 for media
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
AWS_REGION=your_region
# Or Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...

Frontend (.env)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
# Add auth/token related config if necessary

Security: never commit real secrets to source control. Use a secrets manager or CI/CD secrets for production.

## Database & Storage
- If using MongoDB: create a database and update MONGO_URI
- If using PostgreSQL: update DATABASE_URL with connection string and run migrations
- For media (images/videos): configure S3 or Cloudinary credentials and update storage configuration in the backend

## Running Tests & Linting
- Run backend tests:
  cd server
  npm test
- Run frontend tests:
  cd client
  npm test
- Lint:
  npm run lint
- Format:
  npm run format

Adjust the commands to match repository script names.

## Deployment
- Basic deployment options:
  - Docker image to a container host (DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run)
  - Deploy frontend to Vercel / Netlify and backend to Heroku / Render / Railway
  - Ensure environment variables are set in the hosting service
  - Use managed DB (MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS) for production

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Suggested process:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
3. Make changes and add tests
4. Run linting & tests
5. Open a pull request describing the change

Please follow the coding style used in the project and add/update tests for any new behavior.
